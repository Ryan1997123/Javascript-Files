Training Days program (Learning to fix scope issues).
Codecademy.


Task:
As a seasoned athlete, one of your favorite activities is running marathons. 
You use a service called Training Days that sends you a message for the event you signed up for and the days you have left to train.

Since you also code, Training Days has asked you to help them solve a problem: 
The program currently uses the wrong scope for its variables. 
They know this can be troublesome as their service evolves. 
In this project you will make Training Days more maintainable and less error-prone by fixing variable scopes.

Expected Output (may vary): 
Nala's event is: Pentathlon
Nala's time to train is: 200 days
Warren's event is: Marathon
Warren's time to train is: 50 days*/
